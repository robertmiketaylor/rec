# Recession

This repo contains models for probability of recession and time until recession in jupyter notebooks using pandas, numpy, sklearn, and tensorflow in python. Various ML models are used and compared such as logistic, random forest, SVC, voting classifier, and boosting. Then a multi-layer perceptron neural network is modeled with some hyperparameter tuning and compared as well.

\rec\data\ contains data input file.

\rec\src\ contains the jupyter notebooks for the models. "Recession" notebooks are for probability of recession classifier models and "RecTime" are for time until recession regression models.
